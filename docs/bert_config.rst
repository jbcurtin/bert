Bert Configuration File
#######################


bert-etl.yaml
+++++++++++++

With every function in the `jobs.py` file treated as a seperate lambda. Configuring each function, or all functions at once is possbile through the `bert-etl.yaml` file located relative to the module containing `jobs.py`. Lets start with an example,

.. code-block:: yaml

    deployment:
        s3_bucket: my-lambda-function-source

    every_lambda:
        batch_size: 150
        memory_size: 512
        timeout: 900
        environment:
            DEBUG: 'false'
            HOME: /tmp

    bert_tess_fullframe_main_0:
        timeout: 600
        invoke_args:
            - bucket: ffi-lc-cache
              key: mullally_input_list_001.txt
              use_cache: "true"


In the above example, a few different things are happening. `deployment` is telling `bert-etl` which bucket to upload the lambda source to. `every_lambda` is telling `bert-etl` how to configure each lambda when deployed. Finally, 'bert_tess_fullframe_main_0` is telling `bert-etl` that when invoked through the commandline, invoke with one set of arguments.

First, lets drill into how `bert-etl` makes decisions on how to apply the configuration to all lambdas. The first two entries, `deployment` and `every_lambda` are reserved for the `bert-etl.yaml` file. They perform special duties when deploying the codes to AWS Lambda or running the codes locally using `bert-runner.py`.

`deployment` tells `bert-etl` where things go in the cloud. Currently only `s3_bucket` is configured, but it could also contain `region` and an Amazon Resource Name(arn) for an ACM cert.

`every_lambda` idiomaticly means every option defined is applied as default to every lambda in the `jobs.py` file. Overwriting each lambda is possible through defining new entries such as `bert_tess_fullframe_main_0`. `bert_tess_fullframe_main_0` maps directly to a function defined inside `jobs.py`.

At deployment time, AWS lambda function `bert_tess_fullframe_main_0` will have `timeout` set to `600`, while `memory_size` will remain at `512`.


bert-etl.yaml attributes
------------------------

With a firm understanding on how to use `bert-etl.yaml`, lets start talking about some of the options available to the configuration file. Here is a full list with example values.

.. code-block: yaml

        s3_bucket: my-lambda-function-source

    every_lambda:
